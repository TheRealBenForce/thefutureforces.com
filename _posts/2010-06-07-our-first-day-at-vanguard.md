title: The first day at Vanguard
---

On June 6th 2010, Ben and Jenn both started a career at The Vanguard Group in the same department. For the first several weeks they studied together day in and day out to pass the Series 63 and Series 6 exams. Little did they know that more than 4 years later, they would begin a relationship together.
