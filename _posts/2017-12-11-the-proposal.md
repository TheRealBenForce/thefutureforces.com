On December 11th, 2017 Ben and Jenn woke up early to board a flight from Philly to Miami. Little did Jenn know that Ben made the whole journey with an engagement ring in his bag. They rented a car in Miami, stopped for lunch and essentials from Total Wine, and then continued a 4 hour drive to Key West. About an hour from Key West, Ben and Jenn pulled to a secluded beach to stretch our legs and go for a walk. Ben snuck the ring from his bag into his pocket. They walked along a bridge that seemingly went no where. That is where Ben decided to pop the question!
