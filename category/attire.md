Historical average temperatures for this day hit a high of 87 degrees. Jenn and Ben want you to be comfortable so please use this style guide:

### Gentlemen
Feel free to leave the suit jacket and ties at home. Short sleeve button up shirts or polos are also ok. Khakis and dress pants please, no jeans.

### Ladies
Jenn and Ben are sure you will look lovely and don't need our help!
